# Final Report
## Abstract
Due to the recent police activity and call for police reform over the past few months, we want to predict the outcome of a police stop based on a variety of attributes. We thought of the idea based on recent events around police reform and wanted to implement some way to see what happens and what will happen at a police stop. We want to look into what factors are reported for a police stop and see what will be the most important when predicting the stop_outcome.
## Experiments/Analysis
We decided to run the dataset on four different models, Random Forest, Decision Tree, K Nearest Neighbors, and Logistic Regression, to see how the models will perform. We also wanted to find some other details like which column is most important to predict the stop_outcome and if different depths on Decision Tree would make a difference.
